# Prep
 A Repo of practise programs frequently asked in the interviews I have attended and programs to understand some of the basics of python.

 Note: 
 1. The code is intended for readability and understanding rather than performance.
 2. The operation sections contains programs to showcase some of the modules I have worked in. so, I have not added exception handling to it as running this methods in an actual test environment was not the purpose.
